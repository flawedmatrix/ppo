# PPO

Optimized implementation of the Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) algorithm for
Rust.

For performance reasons, written with a modified version of
[dfdx](https://github.com/coreylowman/dfdx), using an older version of cudarc,
so the code is in a fairly unstable state.

Will rewrite with latest libraries if performance can match this current
implementation.
